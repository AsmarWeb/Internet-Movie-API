# IMAPI

Internet Movie API is a sleek React-based web application that allows users to search, browse, and explore detailed information about movies using real-time data from a public movie API (e.g., OMDb or TMDB). With an intuitive UI and responsive design, it delivers movie titles, ratings, summaries, cast info, and more â€” all in one place.
